# BLOCK MATCHING

## Software used-
MATLAB

WE HAVE USED TWO ALGORITHM TO PREDICT THE MOTION COMPENSATED IMAGE:
1) EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH : IN THIS METHOD THE SEARCH AREA FOR A PARTICULAR MACROBLOCK IN THE CURRENT IMAGE IS THE ENTIRE PREVIOUS IMAGE. THUS COMPUTATIONAL TIME INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY, BUT ACCURACY IS MAINTAINED.
2) FOUR STEP SEARCH(4SS) : TO DECREASE THE SEARCH AREA AND THUS DECREASE THE COMPUTATIONAL TIME, WE USE THIS METHOD. THIS METHOD IS AN IMPROVEMNT OVER THREE STEP SEARCH(TSS).

# Problem Statement
NM373-ISRO

Detecting clouds and predicting their movement from INSAT imagery

Contest link :<a href="https://www.sih.gov.in">SIH</a> 

## DATA SET PREPERATION -

Used data provided by ISRO from https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vcms/en/sih2020.html

Processed this data set to make group of 6 images each

Using first five images to learn movement and predict the next image , saved the image to be predicted as result.

### User will be able to see results on the website created. The webpage will show image sequence along with the predicted image. Web page will be updated when ever w'll run the program with some input sequence of cloud flow.
